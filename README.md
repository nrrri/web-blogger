**Web Blog Using Strapi and Next.js**

This GitHub repository contains a web blog application built with Strapi, a headless CMS, and Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and routing. The project consists of several key components:

### Features:
- **Fetching Blogs**: Blogs are fetched from the Strapi API and displayed on the homepage.
- **Individual Blog Pages**: Users can view detailed information about each blog by clicking on them.
- **Special Blogs**: Authentication is implemented to access special blogs, requiring users to log in before viewing.

### Components:
- **Page.js**: Handles fetching and displaying blogs on the homepage.
- **Page.js for Searching Blog/ID**: Allows users to search for specific blogs by ID and displays detailed information.
- **Page.js for Special Blogs**: Implements authentication and displays special blogs based on user authorization.
- **Page.js for Login**: Provides a login interface for users to authenticate and access special blogs.
- **Action.js**: Manages login actions, setting JWT tokens upon successful authentication.
- **Middleware.js**: Implements authentication middleware to ensure authorized access to special blogs.
